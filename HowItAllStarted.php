                    Rick and Morty was created by Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon. The duo first met at Channel 101, a non-profit monthly short film festival in Los Angeles co-founded by Harmon.At Channel 101, participants submit a short film in the format of a pilot, and a live audience decides which pilots continue as a series. Roiland, then a producer on reality programming, began submitting content to the festival a year after its launch, in 2004. His pilots typically consisted of shock valueâ€”"sick and twisted" elements that received a confused reaction from the audience.Nevertheless, Harmon took a liking to his humor and the two began collaborating. In 2006, Roiland was fired from working on a television series he regarded as intensely creatively stifling, and funneled his creative energies into creating a webisode for Channel 101. The result was The Real Animated Adventures of Doc and Mharti, an animated short starring Doc Brown and Marty McFly, characters from the Back to the Future film trilogy. In the short, which Harmon would dub "a bastardization, a pornographic vandalization", Doc Smith urges Mharti that the solution to all of his problems is to give him oral sex. The audience reacted to it wildly, and Roiland began creating more shorts involving the characters, which soon evolved beyond his original intentions and their obvious origin within the film from which it was culled.Harmon would later create and produce Community, an NBC sitcom, while Roiland would work primarily in voice acting for Disney\'s Fish Hooks and Cartoon Network\'s Adventure Time.

                    In 2012, Harmon was fired from Community. Adult Swim, searching for a more prime-time, "hit" show, approached Harmon shortly afterward, who initially viewed the channel as unfit for his style. He also was unfamiliar with animation, and his process for creating television focuses more heavily on dialogue, characters, and story.Instead, he phoned Roiland to inquire if he had any ideas for an animated series. Roiland immediately brought up the idea of using the Doc and Mharti characters, renamed Rick and Morty.Roiland initially wanted the show\'s run time to consist of one eleven-minute segment, but Adult Swim pushed for a half-hour program. Harmon felt the best way to extend the voices into a program would be to build a family around the characters, while Adult Swim development executive Nick Weidenfeld suggested that Rick be Morty\'s grandfather. Having pitched multiple television programs that did not get off the ground, Roiland was initially very unreceptive to others attempting to give notes on his pitch.Prior to developing Rick and Morty, he had created three failed animated pilots for Fox, and he had begun to feel "burned out" with developing television.

                    The first draft was completed in six hours on the Paramount Pictures lot in Dan Harmon\'s unfurnished Community office.The duo had broken the story that day, sold the pilot, and then sat down to write.Roiland, while acknowledging a tendency for procrastination, encouraged Harmon to stay and write the entire first draft."We were sitting on the floor, cross-legged with laptops and I was about to get up and go home and he said, \'Wait, if you go home, it might take us three months to write this thing. Stay here right now and we can write it in six hours.\' He just had a premonition about that," recalled Harmon.Adult Swim was initially unsure of Roiland doing both voices, partially due to the undeveloped nature of the character of Morty. Harmon wrote four short premises in which Morty took a more assertive role and sent it to Mike Lazzo.Adult Swim placed a tamer TV-14 rating on the program, which initially was met with reluctance from the show\'s staff. The network\'s reason behind the rating was that it would soon begin broadcasting in prime-time, competing with major programs.
