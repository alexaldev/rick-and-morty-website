                        While we may not have new Rick and Morty episodes for quite some time, it’s good to know the fans of the show are out there in the world creating all sorts of awesome stuff inspired by the show. A quick search on Google returns a plethora of fan art, video essays, and more than a few musical re-imaginings including this incredibly catchy EDM remix.</p>

<p>English musician Leslie Wai combines more Rick and Morty samples than we can even count and uses them to build an absolutely awesome EDM remix. As with most Rick and Morty songs out there today, the song hits on quite a few of the musical elements that are already in the show as well as the catchphrases you’d expect. However, what’s impressive about Wai’s is how he cut some elements into pieces and is able to build them into something more. Notably Rick’s “Wubba Lubba dub-dub” catchphrase–that’s already pretty darn singsongy–feels right at home in an EDM tune when parts of it continue over the beat around the 50 second mark. Wai also seems to have found the perfect home for “I’m Pickle Rick!” when the drop comes toward the end of the song.</p>

<p>The song is available on SoundCloud along with a link to download it, should you need to make your next road trip or visit to the gym energetic in the schwiftiest of ways.</p>

                        Rick and Morty’s third season has been one of the year’s best TV shows, blending humour, sci-fi antics, and nihilism to almost perfection. </p>

<p>Before the season started, Dan Harmon promised the world 14 episodes, four more than season two. Fans were understandably very excited. </p>

<p>However, this Sunday, the tenth and final episode will air. So, why did Harmon decided to cut the season short? Speaking to Entertainment Weekly, the showrunner explained all.</p>

<p>“I mostly blame myself for doing 10 instead of 14,” he told the publication. “I’m still learning how to do the show efficiently while catering to the perfectionist in all of us. </p>

<p>“I would like to think I’ve learned enough from my mistakes in season 3 that we could definitely do 14 now, but then I have to say, Yeah but you’re the guy who says we can do 14 who turned out to be wrong so we’re not listening to you now.’”</p>
<p>TV preview 2017-18: Everything to look out for Harmon explained how, with season four, he will be promising another 10 episodes, but hopefully prove himself to the network and earn the additional episodes. </p>

<p>“Because I never got this far [working on NBC’s] Community,” he continued. “I fell apart in season three of Community and got fired in season four. Now I’m about to do season four of Rick and Morty and want to prove that I’ve grown.”

                        Rick &amp; Morty Co-Creator Slams McDonald’s Szechuan Sauce Promo 
                    </h2>
                    </div>

                    <div class="news-content">
                    <p>
                        Like virtually everyone else, Rick &amp; Morty co-creator Justin Roiland is not happy with the outcome of the McDonald’s Szechuan Sauce promotion that was inspired by the Adult Swim show. Following the ill-fated one-day-only promo this past weekend, the voice of both Rick and Morty voiced his disapproval of how things went down.
                    </p>
                     <p>
                        Rick &amp; Morty recently wrapped its critically acclaimed third season, but the conversation around the show has been dominated by the chaos that was born out of a throwaway joke from the show’s season 3 premiere. Rick’s reference to a long discontinued promotional McDonald’s dipping sauce for the Disney movie Mulan led to a massive campaign for the fast food chain to bring it back into production. Looking for a way to promote their new chicken tenders, McDonald’s announced an extremely limited, one-day return of the sauce for this past Saturday. This resulted in disaster, as stores were in no way prepared for the demand for the Szeuchuan Sauce, resulting in stores running out almost instantly and being met with hordes of angry fans.
                    </p>
                     <p>
                        Roiland is condemning McDonald’s poorly conceived stunt, tweeting his displeasure with the company’s misfire and urging the show’s notoriously rambunctious fan base to not take out their frustration on McDonald’s employees.
                    </p>
                     <p>
                        The fiasco was a bad look for all parties. McDonald’s was either incredibly incompetent in not understanding the demand for the sauce, or deeply cynical in that they knew this would more or less be the result and garner them plenty of media attention. Reports of fans harassing completely blameless McDonald’s employees and calling for a nationwide boycott only adds fuel to the fire of the narrative that the show’s fan base is filled with some less than great people, an issue that co-creator Dan Harmon recently had to acknowledge.
                    </p>
                     <p>
                        It’s hard not to feel a little bad for Roiland, who created the Szechuan Sauce bit out of his personal obsession with the dipping sauce, and who was ecstatic when McDonald’s sent him a jug of the elusive condiment. McDonald’s attempting to exploit his fan base’s more obsessive impulses has to leave a bad taste in his mouth that has nothing to do with the dipping sauce.
                    </p>
                     <p>
                        For their part, McDonald’s has sort of acknowledged the chaos, promising the sauce will return this winter in a greatly expanded way. Hopefully this time around, the fast food chain will be better prepared for the massive demand, and Rick &amp; Morty’s fans will be able to conduct themselves with a little more grace over a packet of promotional fast food dipping sauce.
